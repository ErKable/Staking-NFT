# Staking-NFT
NFT referral system plus staking platform
The aim of this project is the following:
  1) To create a referral system that ensure incomes to the referral owner
  2) Each referral code has to be used only 10 times and than will be burnt
Basically, by possesing a referral number of another person each user will be able to mint an NFT which will come along with a referral number. When an NFT is minted the owner of the referral will recieve the 25% of the transaction value, and the leftover balance will be sent to fees wallet.

The staking is ment to be part of the phase 2 of the project. Essentially, if a user decide not to use is referral, henche not to get his NFT burnt, he will be able to deposit it into a staking platform which will grant an amount of tokens per block.
